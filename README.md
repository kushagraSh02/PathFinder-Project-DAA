# PathFinder-Project-DAA
A Program to find Shortest Path in a graph using BFS and Dijkstra Algorithms.


The Project was made for our Design and Analysis of Algorithms Lab.
We implement Breadth first search and Dijkstra Algorithms to find the shortest path between the starting and ending vertices.
We have also addeed the visualization feature to allow us to examine the path taken by each of the algorithm for performace comparision purpose.
